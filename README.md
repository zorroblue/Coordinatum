 <b>UNDER PROGRESS!!</b>

This is a basic project of a weather app written in Python using the Tkinter library for GUI work.
To run the program,
in Unix terminal/Windows command prompt,
<strong>

mkdir weatherapp

cd weatherapp

git clone "https://github.com/zorroblue/Weather-Application" #this step depends on which VCS you use

python gui.py

</strong>
This uses the OpenWeather API and Google Map API for fetching data, so the author duly acknowledges them for their superb efforts and work.

In case of bugs,hugs and fixes,contact rameshwar.zorro@gmail.com or even simpler ,report an issue with the bug description.


#TODO Do the important part of fetching and parsing data from the OpenWeather API
#TODO Update the details on the GUI
